# bachelor-project-2223

## 1 Topic and Aim
 - reimplement adap_cluster: https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sistawww/bioi/thijs/Work/Clustering.html

## 2 Deliverables
### 2.0 Meeting Notes
 - planning with TODOs
 - bullet points suffice
 - put it on GitHub
### 2.1 Report
 - due after the Easter break
 - in case of a group project: 1 document, but each (sub)section has 1 responsible student 
   - no duplication of content (as opposed to entirely individual reports)
   - still allows individual assessment of writing (as opposed to a shared report)
 - either in LaTeX or Word
 - content:
 - [Link to Overleaf document](https://www.overleaf.com/9948452851rpkwbjbmyykm)

### 2.2 Scripts, data files
 - all commands you need to create your results are stored in scripts
 - all scripts should be added to GitHub
 - all resulting data files require clear instructions
   - which environment?
   - which scripts?
   - any manual input required?
 - if possible resulting data files should also be added to the GitHub
### 2.3 Presentation
 - date TBD, suggestion: week 13
 - in case of a group project, same concept as report: 1 presentation, individual responsibility per (sub)section
 - 15 minutes presentation
 - 15 minutes Q&A

## 3 Learning outcome
The purpose of this bachelor's thesis is to provide you with an opportunity to experience a typical research problem in a very narrow context.

During this project, the student will:
 - present findings in a structured and clean manner
 - explore the literature about a focused practical problem
 - manage their tasks in a research project: time management, communication with group members and supervisors, deal with challenges, etc
 - perform reproducible research
 - use a version control system (git) in a group project
### 3.1 Relation to Master in Bioinformatics
These learning objectives are further explored during the master, e.g. in Design Project Bioinformatics, Internship, Master's Dissertation, and others.
